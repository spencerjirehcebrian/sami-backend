# Schedule Query Optimizations Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines a phased approach to optimize schedule queries in the SAMi Backend system. The current system has hundreds of schedule records causing performance issues. These optimizations are designed to improve query performance by 5-10x without requiring architectural changes.

## Performance Goals

- Reduce average query time from seconds to milliseconds
- Handle 1000+ schedule records efficiently
- Maintain system responsiveness under load
- No caching dependencies (per requirement)
